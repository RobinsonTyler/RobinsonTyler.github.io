                This is a small testing grounds for basic HTML and CSS testing.<br>
                I have been coding for a few years now, and was only exposed to HTML5/JS last year. I have a lot to learn, and generally use this website to test out different techniques and layouts, especially on touchscreen devices. <br>
                I currently have a few projects on the backburner, some of which involve creating responsive web-apps for mobile as volunteer work. Before I tackle those projects, I want to ensure I have the fundamentals down. The links above are simple experiments with Javascript graphics and event firing (in the form of adaptive resizing), but in the future I hope to have a working demonstration of various features catered towards an interactive experience. <br>
                I would also be interested in testing WebGL and its applications. One of my classes is dedicated to OpenGL rendering through C++, and I'm excited to test how WebGL renders on mobile.<br>
