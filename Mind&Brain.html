<p>Tackling in minor sports, point of contention. Head injuries lead to complications down the road, but does it count as child abuse?
Major athletes have died due to these injuries, and while children are hit less often and with less force, their brain is still developing and damage done is more emergent as they age.</p>

<pre><code>- Correlations
    - No independent variable
    - 2+ dependent variables, and studying the relationship
    - e.g Height vs Weight
    - Pearson's R; where R is the relation between these variables. R ranges from -1 to 1, 
    -1 being inversely proportional, +1 being proportional and 0 being unrelated.
    - Correlations *do not infer* causation
    - Experiments can be done by affecting one of the dependent variables and studying
    the differences observed in the other

<blockquote>
<p>Modern psychology takes completely for granted that behaviour and neural function are perfectly correlated, and that one is completely caused by the other. There is no separate soul or life-force to stick a finger into the brain now and then to make neural cells do what they would not do otherwise ... One cannot logically be a determinist in physics and chemistry and biology, and a mystic in psychology.
(1949)</p>

<p><em>Trepanation</em> - A procedure involving removal of portion of the brain via drilling tools.
This dates back several thousand of years, long before modern medicine. This also indicates that people were aware of the brain's connection to the mind.
Then again, Egyptian mummification involved removing the brain through the nose.</p>

<pre><code>Broca
    - Patient was fully able to understand language, but could not generate speech
    - On death, left frontal cortex had a large lesion (hole)
    - This is now called Broca's area, and is responsible for language expression
    - Words can be spoken, but only with a very small vocabulary
Wernicke
    - Patients similar to Broca's, but with damage to another area of the brain
    - This type of damage allows speech generation, but with poor ordering or relation
    - For example, despite words being coherent, no meaning could be gathered from sentences
Darwin
    - Came up with Materialism: Explaining behaviour without recourse of the mind
    - Theory of natural selection
    - Mutations and changes were more likely to be passed on if they directly aided in survival
        - Possibly beyond survival, but social standing and other factors as well
    - This interrelates the brain structures of all animal species and their behaviours as well
    - Changes in brain and behaviour over time leads to an incredibly complex system

<a id="user-content-hominids" class="anchor" href="#hominids" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hominids</h4>
<pre><code>Homo Neanderthalensis (150 kya)
    - Humans (Homo sapiens, 350 kya) may have wiped out this species
    - OR the two merged through mating
    - Complex rituals for burial 
Homo Erectus (1 mya)
    - Sagittal ridge: Ridge on top of skull
        - Likely aided in having a strong jaw
    - Larger supraorbital torus (Eyebrow bones stick out more..?)
Homo Habilis (2 mya)
A.Africanus (2.5-1.5 mya)
- More debateable_
Homo rudolfensis (1.9 mya)
    - May have overlapped with H.Habilis, H.Erectus
    - Discovered in 1972 in Kobe Fora, Kenya
Homo Ergaster (1.6 mya)
    - Reduced sexual dimorphism
    - Increased orthognathic (flat face, jaw)
    - Likely stood 6'3"
    - Axes and cleavers found at sites
Homo Heidelbergensis (300 kya)
    - Archaic form of H.Sapiens?
Homo Naledi (2 mya - 100 kya)
    - Discovered in 2014
    - Very short, less than half of average H.Sapien
    - Small cranial capacity, 560cc
Homo Floresiensis (100 kya - 12 kya)
    - 4 feet tall, 25 kg
    - Small brain, 380 cc
    - Either new hominid, OR one with microencephalia (small brain)
    - OR it may have been iodine deficient, leading to curved, shrunken bones
Australopithecus Sediba (2 mya)
    - Very small, found in good condition
</code></pre>
<p>Another important metric is brain volume to body mass. Australopithecus follows closely with the Great Apes. Comparitively, H.Sapiens have one of the greatest ratios. Not only are they (we) havier than H.Erectus and Habilis, we have a higher ratio of brain to weight.

Rushton sided with Burt
Scientifically, the correlation is nearly 0

This research was wrought with errors:
    &gt; How is the brain measured?
    &gt; No control for thickness of skull
    &gt; Volume vs weight
    &gt; Age/Health/Dietary differences
    &gt; CerebroSpinal Fluid

<p>Males have larger brains than females, though females have more complex structures in the frontal cortex
How do you determine intelligence anyway?
How do you equate skills of differing fields in a balanced way?
Is this a product of causality? Environment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gross Brain Size doesn't appear to correlate to intelligence <em>however</em> areas of the brain are tied to functions, and can expand based on the types of activity that the person tends to do. For example, the portion of the brain that activates in the presence of music is likely to be larger if the person is a musician.</p>

<p>Neurons are nonstatic cells. They often change shape, connections are made and broken on the fly.
<strong>Neuroplasticity</strong> accurately describes this pattern.
Neurons are also finite. They do not regrow after death, and after age 12-13, neuron growth gradually slows.
After age 22-23, neuron growth stops. Neurons eventually die off, which is simply a product of growing old.</p>

<pre><code>from Greek 'Glue'
10-50 per neuron
Ependymal Cells
    * Found along the walls of ventricles
    * Produces CSF
    * Any blockage causes hydroencephalus
Microglia
    * Found within the CNS
    * Very mobile, found in blood
    * Clean up dead neurons
    * Phagocytosis: Scavenge debris via consuming deceased cells
Astrocytes/Astroglia
    * Star shaped cells in CNS
    * Aids in neuron structure and synchronization
    * Keep neurons close to the blood supply
    * Form the blood-brain barrier
    * Neurons can request additional oxygen/glucose via these astrocytes
    * Not necessarily passive cells, but can manipulate neural activity in an unknown way
Oligodendria/Schwann cells
    * Both are used to make up Myelin as in the Myelin sheath
    * Made of fats, lipids and proteins
    * Schwann cells comprise the myelin in the peripheral nervous system ****
    * Oligodendria cells make up the myelin in the CNS ****
    * Multiple Sclerosis is the loss of myelin in the CNS
    * ALS is the decrease of myelin in motor neurons
    * Oligodendrocytes cover many (around 15) neurons
    * Schwann cells only cover one neuron each, and may require multiple to cover an axon
    * Schwann cells can aid in neuron repair
    * Oligodendria do not regrow, any damage done remains.
        * Neuroplasticity can aid in regaining functionality, but nerves generally do not reattach
Radial Glia
    * Only seen in early phases of development
    * Basically, these are the guide wires that neurons use to find their connections
    * After they are no longer needed, they can become a different type of glial, or even a neuron
    * Active research is being done on these cells; similar to a stem cell but more focused
    * The growth of these cells is highly calculated and choreographed

<p><strong>Extracellular</strong> : Outside Cell
<strong>Intracellular</strong> : Inside Cell
Seawater and Extracellular fluid have roughly the same concentrations of Na+, Cl- and K+.
In contrast, Intracellular fluid has very low amounts of Na+ and Cl-, but very high amounts of K+.
This balance is maintained by the <em>Cell Membrane</em>; which is created with a Hydrophylic head and a Hydrophobic tail.</p>
<p>At rest, a neuron's Na+ and K+ channels are closed. Because of the charges inside the neuron, the neuron has a charge of -70 millivolts. K+ can leave because of the concentration gradient, but can also be absorbed because of the chemical gradient.
Electroconvulsive Therapy is used to treat major depression, and involves two electrodes being placed on the side of the head. After a current is passed, the patient enters an induced seizure. Post seizure, the patient is unaware of what occurred, but depressive thoughts are decreased. Modern ECT can involve the use of seizure-suppresent medications or stimulations via magnetic tools.</p>

<p><strong>Graded Potentials</strong>: Across the membrane, axon stimulations can affect the local charge of a given area.
Hyperpolarizations Increase the electrical charge across a membrane (more negative) by intaking more Cl- and exporting more K+, also called <em>Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials</em>
Tetraethylammonium blocks K+ and prevents this effect</p>
<p>Depolarization is the inverse of hyperpolarization, usually caused by Na+ entering the cell, also called <em>Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials</em>
Tetrodotoxin blocks Na+ channels and prevents this effect</p>

    * ~-50 mV relative to extracellular surround
    * Sort of like trigger-weights on guns; the weight increases up to a point before the explosive action potential is released
    * Voltage sensitive channels open up at this ~-50 mV threshold

    * Absolute
        * The depolarizing/repolarizing period
        * It can't get it up, regardless of the stimulation
    * Relative
        * With enough stimulation, the cell can fire again

<a id="user-content-synapse" class="anchor" href="#synapse" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Synapse</h4>
<p>Very small connection between neurons
Speed of conduction along an axon is about 40 meters per second
If many axons are strung together, this speed can reduce to 15m per second
Axon Hillock are very rich in voltage sensitive channels where EPSP and IPSP summate. If the sum of the electrical activity reaches higher than -50mV, the Action Potential is triggered.
Hillocks are located at the base of the axon</p>

<p><em>Temporal:</em> Close in time
<em>Spatial:</em> Close in space
Essentially, the total electrical activity per a given location has a larger magnitude if the pulses are physically and timewise nearby. Spatial summation can also involve order, as the dendrites of a neuron contain many branches. If many signals reach the cell starting from the top and reaching towards the cell body, the signal is amplified more than if the inverse occurs.</p>
<h3>
<a id="user-content-transmission" class="anchor" href="#transmission" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transmission</h3>
<p>The act of a neuron on the pre-synaptic side releasing a chemical (with an excitatory or inhibitory effect) to be used on the post-synaptic neuron. These chemicals are known as <em>Neurotransmitters</em> which are known as hormones when in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>(A)---------&lt;(B)</p>
<p><strong>Presynaptic Membrane</strong>: Action Potential propagates from here (End of <em>A</em>s axon)
<strong>Postsynaptic Membrane</strong>: Receives the action potential (B)
Synapses can vary based on activation methods. Some neurons are strictly electrical, which benefit from insanely high speed. Electrical synapses are essentially fused together with gapes aligned in the pre- and postsynaptic membranes enabling immediate ion transfer. The downside to these types of synapses is that they cannot be fixed or changed. These are static cells, and neuroplasticity does not apply.</p>

<a id="user-content-neurotransmission" class="anchor" href="#neurotransmission" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Neurotransmission</h4>
<pre><code>1. Sythesis
    * Neurotransmitter is synthesized and stored in axon terminal
        * Good for smaller neurotransmitters
        * Diet based, foods determine the types and variety of NT available
    * Also stored in the cell body (neuropeptides)
        * According to DNA and transported via microtubules to axon terminal
    * Synaptic vesicle stores the neurotransmitters, kind of like a bubble
    * MAO (monoamine oxidase) breaks down excess Neurotransmitters
        * MAO inhibitors yields more NT available, used (early on) for depression treatment
2. Action Potential
    * Propagates through the axon
3. Releases
    * NT is brought to the presynaptic membrane and released in an action potential 
    * Ca++ channels open, binding to a protein called calmodulin****
        * These calmodulin complexes cause some vesicles to burst and release the NT into the synaptic gap
    * This process is exocytosis**** (See image)
    * Via retrograde transport, the vesicle is reformed on the cell membrane
4. Receptors
    * NT activates the receptors on the postsynaptic membrane
    * Receptors either hyperpolarize, depolarize the cell or cause chemical reactions within the cell
    * There are some receptors located on the presynaptic side, generally used to "shut off" the flow of NT 
    * These are autoreceptors, generally used exclusively for one or two variants of neurotransmitter
5. Inactivations
    * The NT is deactivated, else the signal never stops working
    * This reset can be done via four methods: 
        * Diffusion: NT floats away from synapse
        * Degradation via enzymes in synaptic cleft
        * Reuptake**** into the presynaptic axon by transporters. Once returned they can be reused
        * Absorbed by neighboring glial cells and returned later
6. Feedback
    * Messages arrive to control release of NT by the presynaptic cell

<p>Neurotransmitters can be inhibitory or excitatory
More than one neurotransmitters may be active at a single synapse
<strong>Dales Law</strong>: 1 neuron, 1 transmitter. Essentially, neurons are single purpose. <em>This is incorrect</em>
There are no simplifactions to be made, this stuff is complex.</p>
<p>The postsynaptic side has two types of receptors:
<strong>Ionotropic Receptors</strong> - direct binding sites
<strong>Metabotropic</strong> - Binding sites, but with no direct pore or channel.
Enzymes are released to open additional channels for intake or expulsion of ions.
Upon NT binding, a g-protein is released</p>
<p><strong>Drugs</strong> - A chemical compound administered to produce a desired effect on the body
<strong>Psychoactive drug</strong> - A drug targetting behaviour and the CNS
Psychopharmacologists study how different drugs affect the CNS and behaviour</p>

<pre><code>DSM5 diagnostic symptoms:
    Delusions - Believing a falsity to be true beyond a reason of a doubt
    Hallucinations - Indistinguishable from reality for one experiencing it
    Disorganized speech
    Disorganized behaviour
    Weak or absent signs of emotions, speech or socialization (suppressed)
Type 1: Positive Symptoms
    Excess of symptoms and normative values, including agitated movements, exaggerated responses
    Some relation to the dopaminergic dysfunction
    Treatable with a favourable outcome
    Not always perfect, but antipsychotics do improve symptoms
Type 2: Negative Symptoms
    Deficient in regular behaviours, neurological issues
    Enlarged ventricles in the brain, increasing pressure and damaging the cortex
    Cortical atrophy, smaller proportions
    When measuring cerebral blood flow, prefrontal cortex activity is reduced
    Abnormalities in Wernicke's area, auditory areas, hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
Pyrimidal neurons in the hippocampus are generally aligned with one another
Schizophreniacs have slightly less ordered pyrimidal neurons
Dopaminergic receptors (in striatal areas (Striatum is a basal ganglia)) are increased
First-Generation Antipsychotics:
    Chlorpromazine antagonises these D2 dopaminergic receptors, reducing the signal
    Antagonists that block the D2 receptors often have a side effect on the motor system
    This manifests as slower reaction, movement and communication skills, similar to Parkinsons
        This is called Dyskinesia
        Too much D2 antagonist results in Parkinson-like symptoms
        Too little, no improvement in Schizophrenia symptoms
Secon-Gen
    Block D2 receptors, but weaker than First Gen
    Side effects include weight gain
Ketamine ("Special K")
    Creates a dissociative state, similar to an anesthetic
    High dose varies massively between humans, and is fatal when misused

    Sleep disturbances, disruptions in eating habits
        Sleep deprivation can sometimes aid symptoms
    Frequent thoughts of suicide
    Difficulty engaging in life
    Excessive duration
    Very common, 5% of population currently, 30% of population has experienced before
    Discussing with a trusted friend can sometimes alleviate symptoms
    Antidepressants: 
        Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors
            Block MAO from breaking down dopamine, noradrenalin and serotonin
            This increases the amounts of these NTs in the body, improving mood
            MAO is normally in the synaptic clefts of neurons
            This type of drug is an AGONIST because it improves the synaptic function of the cell
            Dry mouth and hypertension are common side-effects
        Tricyclic Antidepressants
            First generation (70-80s) blocked reuptake of transporter proteins
            Noted for the triple ring structure
            Because NTs couldn't be returned to the cell, extra seratonin and norepinepherine is made available
            Ex: Amitriptyline
        Second generation antidepressants (Selective Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors) 
            Blocks seratonin reuptake
            Most frequently prescribed
            Increase in depressive symptoms years into use, short term basis yields positive results (Placebo?)
            Most antidepressants don't work right away
            Delayed effect is also attributed to patient misuse
            Ex: Prozac (fluoxetine)
Bipolar Disorder
    Similar to depression, but with episodes of extreme mania
    Lithium used since 60s to aid symptoms, may increase reuptake of norepinepherine or serotonin
        Not really known why this works so well
    Lithium crosses the BBB extremely well (as a single ion, it should!)
    Antidepressants do not work at all for these patients
</code></pre>
<p>Alcohol binds to GABA receptors, similar to barbituates
Barbituates create sedation and sleep, all the way up to anesthesia, coma and death
Benzodiazephines (Ex: Valium, diazepam) are used as mini-tranquilizers and insomnia medications
Alcohol multiplies the effects of benzodiazephines, creating an incredible difficulty triggering action potentials necessary for life, including breathing and maintaining a heart beat</p>
<pre><code>**Psychadelics** alter sensory perception and cognitive processes
Four Main types:

    Serotonin
        LSD
        Somatic, perceptual and psychic phases
        Not necessarily harmful on its own, however the hallucinogenic effects often result in unintentional suicides or harm
    Tetrahydrocannabinol
        THC
        One of 400 ingredients found in cannabis
        THC inhibits the function of an enzyme used in pain transmission
        Pre-80s, as much as a third of all high school students tried it
        80-90s, dropped below 25%
        Currently, number hovers around 38%
        Main neuro-receptor is CB1, found in CNS and PNS
            Anandamide has a high affinity for CB1, causes many side-effects of THC
            Analgesic properties
        CB2 can be found in spleen and other organs
        THC can affect menstrual cycle and reduced sperm generation in males, alongside increase in testicular cancer
        Nonlethal, CB1 receptors are not related to key functionality   
            Most of the concern for marijuana is in brain development
            Many papers have been created, but the test group is generally not aimed at the casual user
            Generally, test group is centered around addicts
            Cannabis users have a reduction in the number of connections in the upper orbital area of the brain
        Cannabis also effects dopamine sensitization in acute psychosis patients
            For these patients, anything might trigger a reaction
            However, cannabis does generally trigger these events, and can make them worse

<a id="user-content-senses" class="anchor" href="#senses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Senses</h3>
<p><em>Sensation</em> is the registration of physical stimuli by sensory organs
<em>Perception</em> is the realization and analysis of these sensations in the human brain</p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong>
A blind spot exists in the field of vision due to the optic nerve taking place of optic receptors in the retina.
The <em>fovea</em> is a portion of the retina that allows for high degrees of acuity when compared to the peripherals.
Vision is the absorption of EM waves in the range 400 (violet) to 700 (red) nanometer wavelengths (nm is 1/billon)
Common problems include Myopia (nearsightedness) which is the issue of light focussing before the retina. This is contrasted by Hyperopia, which has the opposite effect.

<p>##<strong>Photoreceptors</strong>:
Rods
Sensitive to dim light
Used primarily for night vision and singular pigment colors
Most common in peripheral vision
Cones
Concentrated in fovea
Specialized for color
Three color variants, RGB.
Optimal wavelengths are:
Blue: 420nm
Green: 534nm
Red: 564nm
There are fewer blue cones compared to red and green
Color blindness
Difficulty differentiating colors due to reduction or disappearance in one type of pigmented cone
Linked to the X chromosome
5-8% in males, 0.5% in females
RG colorblindness is much more common then CY</p>
<p>How do we see color?
<strong>Trichromatic Theory</strong> explains this by breaking each color down into their RGB components. This does a great job explaining how colorblindness comes about, but fails to explain afterimages and other visual phenomena</p>
<p>Afterimages appear when "fatigued" cells continuously display the same color after use</p>
<p><strong>Opponent-Process Theory</strong> emphasizes opposite colors, which are processed in retinal ganglion cells.
On-Off center/surround : Each specific cone has the base receptor in the center, followed by a surrounding receptor for the opposing color. In this way, if the primary color is shown in the center and the opposite appears in the surrond, the activity of the receptor increases. If the inverse occurs, virtually no activity is shown.</p>

<a id="user-content-lecture-9" class="anchor" href="#lecture-9" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lecture 9</h2>
<p>Both the opponent process and trichromatic theory have limitations. Another theory exists called <em>retinex theory</em>, which emphasizes how the brain interprets the visual information passed along by the retina. In this way, the ability for the eye to distinguish colors despite changes in lighting (Color/Brightness Constancy) is taken account for, where the previous two theories failed to explain it.</p>

<p>Information is blurred by horizontal cells lying underneath the initial photoreceptor, which may act as a kind of balance fro brightness and color intensity to ensure action potentials do not fire unless a certain threshold of photoreceptors report a similar thing.</p>

<p>The pathways that visual information takes is a bit confusing
When viewing an object, information is taken from <em>both</em> eyes. This information crosses the brain through the <strong>optic chiasm</strong> <em>only</em> if the image is seen from the temporal side of the eye. If the image is seen directly by one eye, it does not cross over.</p>
<p>The path to the primary visual cortex is called the lateral genticulate nucleus</p>

<p>The pathways can also be broken up into dorsal and ventral pathways
<em>Dorsal</em> meaning "up", handles the "how". Starting in the occipital cortex and projects to the parietal cortex.
Dorsal also handles action pathway, including reaching and grasping
<em>Ventral</em> handles projections into the temporal cortex, and is involved with object recognitions</p>
<p>Damage to the Dorsal and Ventral streams include Optic Ataxia and Agnosia</p>
<p><strong>Ataxia</strong> is the difficulty reaching for objects, <strong>Agnosia</strong> causes difficulties recognizing basic and complex shapes, most commonly faces. Agnosia is entirely visual and not common.</p>

<p>But how is information regarding spatial awareness and positioning in the brain represented?</p>
<p><em>Receptive Fields</em>, which are also called cellular topographic mapping, is a reference to the area relative to the retina that would cause a cell to activate. In this way, the brain can realize where an object is relative to the eye based on what ganglion has fired.</p>
<p>A good <a href="http://scholarpedia.org/article/Area_V1" rel="nofollow">link</a> for the area V1 in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>The receptive fields (RF) of many retinal ganglion cells make up the RF of one LGN cell, which is one of many portions of the RF of a V1 cell.</p>

<p>On center and Off center cells also exist, with inverse trigger mechanics.
Ganglion cells in the retina do not have any shape recognition built in, they simply activate according to their center surround mechanism (On or Off center) being exposed to light.</p>
<p>Retinal cells can code edges of shapes, as shown below:

<p>Columns in V1 detect orientations, with some cells firing on horizontal lines and others at varying angles.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Cells</strong> have an RF with a <em>rectangular</em> on/off arrangement
<strong>Complex Cells</strong> are excited when bars of light move in a given direction. If the direction of motion shifts off of the preferred orientation, the signal diminishes
<strong>Hypercomplex Cells</strong> are complex cells that also have an inhibitory section of their RF at a given end.</p>

<p>####Vestibular System
CNVIII (Vestibular Nerve)
In the ear is a vestibular organ
3 semicircular canals (Jelly-like substance w/ hair cells)
Fluid is called endolymph
Fluid moves independent to the head thanks to inertia
Cilia located along the top of the hairs poking into this fluid bend along with the fluid
Depending on the direction of the bend, cilia can be depolarized or hyperpolarized
Otolith Organs (Utricle and Saccule)
Calcium Carbonate
Two functions of the vestibular organs:
* Position of the body in terms of gravitational center
* Changes in direction and speed of the head</p>

####Somatosensory System
Provides bodily sensations Including
* Touch
* Temperature
* Pain
* Position in Space
* Movement in Joints
Very close relationship to motor actions, especially in comparison to the other senses
Allows the distinction between environment and reactions to it
Receptors
Nocioception - Pain and Temperature
Hapsis - Fine touch and Pressure
Proprioception - Location and movement of body parts
Receptors can also be broken down into two forms:
Fast-Adapting Receptors - Activate very briefly on beginning and end of a stimulation
Procioceptive &amp; Hapsis
Slow-Adapting Receptors - Responds throughout the duration of a stimulus
Nocioception &amp; Hapsis
Skin
Hairy skin - Few numbers of receptors, not nearly as sensitive
Glabrous skin - Very high numbers of receptors, incredibly sensitive
E.g. Lips, palms, face</p>
<p><strong>Dermatones</strong>
Dorsal Root Ganglion Neurons
Proprioceptive and Haptic Neurons are large and heavily myelinated
Nocioceptive neurons are very small with little myelination
Deafferented references an area that no longer provides signals from the somatosensory neurons</p>
<p>Nocioception travels to the brain via the Anterolateral (Right) System, while Hapsis travels along the Ipsilateral (Left) system.</p>
<p>All somatosensory information travels to the Primary Somatosensory Cortex, which also receives projections from the thalamus. <em>Brodmanns Areas</em> 3-1-2, located behind the __ gyrus.</p>
<p>There's also the secondary Somatosensory Cortex, which integrates information taken from the somatosensory system and motor control system. It also takes some information from the dorsal and ventral visual streams.</p>
<p><strong>Apraxia</strong> is the inability to make voluntary movements in the absence of paralysis. This can manifest as not being able to use tools and objects in a proper way.</p>
<h4>
<a id="user-content-pain" class="anchor" href="#pain" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Pain</h4>
<pre><code>Pain and stress causes the release of Endorphins into the PAG (Periaueductal gray)
Activation of the endorphin circuit has many neural origin
    Cingulate cortex during placebo analgesia (More emotional side of pain)
    Amygdala in the case of fear-induced analgesia
Substance P (PAIN)
    Neuropeptide involved in the transmission of intense pain, such as broken bones
    Pain Gate
        Up to a certain threshold, exciting the somatosensory of pressure alleviates pain
        After this threshold, pain is amplified
    70% of amputees experience phantom pain, where the removed limb seems to experience pain
    This phantom pain is generated in the brain

<a id="user-content-lecture-11-movement" class="anchor" href="#lecture-11-movement" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lecture 11: Movement</h2>
<p><strong>Muscles</strong>: Divided into Skeletal/Striated (Move the limbs, striped appearance), Smooth (Organ movement and internal processes) and Cardiac.
Muscles contract and relax, and are organized into pairs: <strong>Extensor</strong> and <strong>Flexor</strong>, which controls movement away from the body; E.G the bicep is a Flexor, making the forearm approach the body. The tricep works on the opposing side, bringing the forearm away from the body (Acting as an Extensor). In this way, the flexor and extensor are antagonistic, providing incredible control over limb placement and smooth movements. This combination also limits tremors and shaking.</p>
<p><em>Spinal Cord Reflexes</em> depend on the spinal cord alone, such as scratch reflex and pain reception. Damage to the spinal cord can result in paralysis such as paraplegia or quadroplegia. Higher than C2 and C3 can cause problems relating to cardio control.</p>
<p>Motor Neurons in the spinal cord (along the Final Common Pathway) interface with interneurons and motor neurons to produce movement.</p>
<p><strong>Reflexes</strong> can be divided up into <em>Monosynaptic Reflexes</em>, which require only one synapse in the ventral horn in the spinal cord before a signal is received, and multisynaptic reflexes, which rely on sensory data and information before proceding with an action.</p>
<p>Muscles also incorporate Proprioceptors, such as the <strong>Muscle Spindle</strong> (stretching) and <strong>Golgi Tendon Organ</strong> (Overextensions)</p>
<p><em>Central Pattern Generators</em> is the idea that multiple monosynaptic reflexes can be combined into more complex movement including walking.</p>

<pre><code>* Corticospinal Tract (Pyramidal Tract)
    * Buncle of nerve fibres directly connecting the cerebral cortex to the spinal cord
    * Operates on Layer 5
* Visuomotor
    * Has to be processed before actions can take place
* Cerebellum is a huge motor center in the brain, encompassing 22 billion neurons
    * Two hemispheres, "homuncular" organization
    * Flocculus (Medial) - Eye movements and balance
    * Lateral Parts - Movements of limbs, digits, feet, hands
    * Medial Parts - Movements of face and midline of body
    * Nystagmus - Eye drift caused by damage to flocculus
    * Two main functions: 
        * Timing in motor sequencing
        * Error correction; active trimming to achieve desired movement
    * Alcohol hits this area quick and hard, creating the side effects
* Basal Ganglia / Nuclei
    * Very important for motor control
    * Dopamine and the substantia nigra are the most important things to remember
    * Damage to this area affects as if a volume knob has been cranked
        * Hyper/Hypokinetic problems
        * Parkinson's disease is caused by lack of dopamine (Hypokinetic)
        reaching the substantia nigra
        * This causes resting tremor, and reduced emotional presentation on face
        * Tourette's and Huntington's disease are Hyperkinetic
* Forebrain and Initiating Movements
    * Karl Lashley (50's)
        - Movement Modules were preprogrammed by the brain to move as one
        - A module may be paused while other modules can be turned off when inactive
    * Frontal lobes:
        1. Prefrontal COrtex: Planning of Movements
        2. Premotor Cortex: Integrate information for movement
        3. Supplementary Motor Cortex: Organizes motor sequences
        4. Primary Motor Cortex: Procudes specific movements
* Brainstem
    * Survival-related behaviours including locomotion and grooming
    * Very particular to each species
    * Stimulation requires very specific contextual conditions
* Motor Cortex
    * 1870 - Fritsch and Hitzig
        * Electrical stimulation of a dog's cortex produced movement
    * 1930 - Wilder Penfield
        * Mapped cortices of humans using electrical stimulations
    * Humuncular representation - physically mapped location to given areas of the body
    * Topographic Organization - Neural spatial representation of the body,
         as perceived by a sensory organ
    * Damage caused by stroke/lesion causes adaptation, if therapy is not given.
        * For example, damage to the left hand in the M.C. without therapy will
          cause surrounding areas to overtake it. With therapy, the surrounding 
          neurons will take on the responsibility, regaining control of the hand
